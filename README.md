# dojo-battleships
battleships starter projects with a few failing unit tests - for use in an Object Calisthenics coding Dojo

based on the game battleships as described on wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)

## General
- pass and play between one player and a computer (AI, deep MIND, Google's finest!). 
- User enters his name to start, and presses enter to start game.
- (to save time, the board layout for both the computer and human player is auto generated by the computer, yes, yes, slight advantage to the computer, cof cof!)
- The game is played on four grids, two for each player. 
- The grids are square – 10×10 – and the individual squares in the grid are identified by letters and numbers 
- one grid (Your ships) represents the player arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent. 
- On the other grid (Enemy ships) the computer records the players own shots.

**Board arrangement**

- See image below (*)
- each ship occupies a number of squares, also shown is the quantity of ships 
  - 1 x Aircraft [5]
  - 1 x Battleship [4]
  - 1 x cruiser [3]
  - 2 x Destroyer [2]
  - 2 x Submarine [1]
- ships cannot overlap

**Playing the game**
- the game proceeds in a series of rounds. 
- In each round, each player takes a turn to announce ( enter the grid coordinate of his shot, into a text prompt) a target square in the opponent's grid which is to be shot at. 
- The computer announces whether or not the square is occupied by a ship, and if it is a "miss", the computer marks their primary grid with a dash '-'; if a "hit" they mark this on their own primary grid with a cross 'X'. 

When all of the squares of a ship have been hit, the ship is sunk, and the computer prints at the bottom of the screen ( "You sank my "battleship!"  {SHIP}). If all of a player's ships have been sunk, the game is over and their opponent wins.

Dojo attendees can choose details, how and where to display the 'announcements' of ships being sunk, and any other missing detail.

**Game end - Winning**
-  First human or computer to sink all of his or her or IT's opponents ships ends the game and a "YOU WON" or "I WON" is displayed, together with a message, "Do you want to play again?"

Not too much detail in the requirements; Enough description to show what to do. 

**Objective is not to complete the project, but to practice the 9 object calisthenics rules.**

# Unit tests

The following failing unit tests are in the solution;

###board layout at the start of the game

```
   given a board for the human player
   and a board for the computer
   when the game starts
   then the boards will be "randomly setup"

```
